Win JS app
This is a POC who was aksed as a project school. 

Subject was : 

Using Windows Store Apps, WinJS & HTML5 or C# & XAML, use your imagination and creativity to create an original and innovative application. Please your application should only be done using Visual Studio 2013 or later.

You can create whatever application you want but with some restrictions:

Use a navigation template. Your application must:

- Be a Windows 8/10 Application using WinJS (choose the idea that you want). 

- Implement all the Metro UI Design concept.

- Implement all features from the following list

o A map 

o A media element : take a picture of your self

o A search : search for elements in a documentation (here, the data are generated basics from visual studio as I tried to get functionnality before datasets)

o A settings page

o An AppBar

o (At least) One Rating Bar 

o Toast Notifications

o Reading data from a file or an API in JSON or XML : use a json API (here, a random one for test)
